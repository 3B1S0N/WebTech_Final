INSPIRATION

This project was inspired by young event organisers that have no way of truly tracking their progress on the go. 
They were looking for a quick and easy system to track their progress but also efficient enough to give them insight.

FUNCTIONS

Create
Retrieve
Update
Delete
Gather Insight


OVERVIEW

The event management system allows you to create, retrieve, update and delete information concerning an event relating solely to you.
It makes heavy use of database functionalities to perform these functions as well as give the insight. The front end is a composition of libraries,
personal tinkering and some ideas I pre-destined for this project. This project also makes use of javascript for the validation of the password as well 
as some other key features to incorporate the strength of the password.
